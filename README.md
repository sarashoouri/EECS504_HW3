Motion Magnification and Texture Synthesis
In this algorithm, we will build up a new texture pixel by pixel. We start by sampling a small patch from the source texture and use it to initialize the center of the new texture. We then recursively fill in the boundaries of this patch until all the pixels in the target have been considered. For each pixel, we take a window and do an exhaustive search over the source texture to find the closest window. There are many distances metrics we could use for comparison, but for simplicity, we will use the sum-of-squared differences (SSD). We take the center pixel of this window and copy its color into the target texture. We also want to give pixels near the center of the window more weight because they are probably more important in finding a well-matched window. We do this by weighing the window with a Gaussian kernel. This has the effect such that the closer a pixel is to the center, the more it contributes to the distance metric.
